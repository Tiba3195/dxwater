# dxwater
DxWater demonstrates a custom water shader I have created and tweaked over time. I think the water effect is pretty good, but I haven't found a use for it so this is just a way of releasing the code to the outside world!

As well as the water effect, this little tech demo uses a combination of custom collision detection, custom mesh and texture classes and extensive shaders to create an environment that can be quite cool to explore and mess with.

The **WASD** keys will move the camera (and you can hold **Q** to run), **Left mouse** will grab/release the light (when close enough) and **Up** and **Down** arrow keys will change the water level.
