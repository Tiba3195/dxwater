DxWater demonstrates a custom water shader I have created and tweaked over time. I think the water effect is pretty good, but I haven't found a use for it so I'm just going to put the source code here as I'd like it to be seen be the outside world somehow!

As well as the water effect, this little tech demo uses a combination of custom collision detection, custom mesh and texture classes and extensive shaders to create an environment that can be quite cool to explore and mess with.

The **WASD** keys will move the camera (and you can hold **Q** to run), **Left mouse** will grab/release light (when close enough) and **Up** and **Down** arrow keys will change the water level.
